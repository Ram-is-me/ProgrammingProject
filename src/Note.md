# Note

The base classes I have declared above are the general class structure for a matrix. Those who require the square symmetric matrix to perform additional functions, please add those functions to the SymmetricMatrix class so that everyone works on the same class defenitions for the matrix.

A vector of doubles will act as a record for us.
